<h3 id="article-topic"> Problem </h3>
<p id="article-text">
Crafting an item multiple times in a row is one of the most inconvenient operations in the game. When taking on the process you will be faced with multiple interactions, animations and text dialogue. After you are done crafting the first item, you can loop back into the item selection menu to keep crafting, with the cursor already on the last item you had crafted. It feels like the developers knew players would need to repeat this process more than once but didn't go the whole way to give you a “multi-craft” option.
</p>
<br>
</br>
<p id="article-text">
To create multiples of the same item in ACHN, the process list reads as follow:
<ul class="a">
    <li>Interact with the crafting bench</li>
    <li>Crafting dialogue</li>
    <li>Select the crafting option</li>
    <li>Select the item you want to craft</li>
    <li>Confirm you want to craft it</li>
    <li>Crafting animation</li>
    <li>Completion dialogue</li>
    <li>Select the "Keep Crafting" option</li>
    <li>Character turnaround animations</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
</br>
<p id="article-text">
After the character turnaround, you are brought back to the item selection menu. To get some perspective, creating 10 of the same item is a 63 step program: 9 steps for the first item, then 9 loops of 6 steps for the remaining items.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="article-topic"> Solution </h3>
<p id="article-text">
The goal would be to reduce the amount of steps required by breaking that loop and giving the player a straight line to what they want. This would improve flow using the crafting system and add value by getting our player back to playing rather than mashing the A button. This solution would involve asking the player how many of the items they want to craft.
<br>
<br>
At the beginning of the game, crafting multiple items is not really a concern though. It is definitely more of a quality of life improvement for the player when they reach later stages of the game where they actually have to farm multiple resources.
<br>
<br>
So the integration of multi-craft for the player should come in the same form as any quality of life improvement for other aspects of the game such as the inventory space and tool handling upgrades. That would be through a purchasable upgrade in the Automatic Bells Dispenser machine’s Nook Miles reward menu. You would find the multi-craft upgrade as a 10 000 Miles reward under the name: “Crafting Efficiency Guide”.

<h3 id="article-topic"> Reference Point </h3>
<p id="article-text">
When going through the experience for the first time, I instantly got in my mind Pokemon's Pokemart options to buy the same item in bulk. It's a simple system that works well and has been part of their games since the beginning of the series. For comparison, Pokemon's process list reads as follow:
<ul class="a">
    <li>Interact with the Pokemart vendor</li>
    <li>Vendor dialogue</li>
    <li>Select the buy option</li>
    <li>Select the item you want to buy</li>
    <li>Select how many you want of the item</li>
    <li>Confirm your purchase</li>
    <li>Completion dialogue</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
After the completion dialogue, you are brought back to the item selection menu. In total to get 10 items, it would take the player 7 actions, 9 to exit the menus and get back to playing.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="article-topic"> What it would look like </h3>
<p id="article-text">
For example, the player wants to craft 5 “flimsy axe” items. After choosing it in the item selection menu, the standard menu to craft it opens up.
<br>
<br>
Next to the “Craft it!” button, you will now have a counter with arrows to let you select how many of an item you want to select.
<br>
<br>
Use the up option on the joystick or d-pad to increase the number on the counter of items produced and use the down option to decrease the number on the counter of items produced.
<br>
<br>
If your indicator shows x1, going down will loop to the maximum amount of items you can craft.
<br>
<br>
Press on A to accept crafting the chosen number of items.
<br>
<br>
Press on B if you want to  go back to the item selection menu.
<br>
<br>
When pressing on A to craft, there is a check to see if there is enough space in your inventory to create that many items before the confirmation.
<br>
<br>
If there is enough space in your inventory, when pressing on A a confirmation window opens with the message: “Craft 5 flimsy axe?”.
<br>
<br>
Once you have confirmed, the standard crafting animation starts and follows regular steps.
<br>
<br>
Our process list would then read as follows:
<br>
<br>
<ul class="a">
    <li>Interact with the crafting bench</li>
    <li>Crafting dialogue</li>
    <li>Select the crafting option</li>
    <li>Select the item you want to craft</li>
    <li>Change the amount of items you want to craft if necessary</li>
    <li>Confirm you want to craft it</li>
    <li>Crafting animation</li>
    <li>Completion dialogue</li>
    <li>Select if you want to keep crafting</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
By making this change we would turn a 63 step operation to create 10 of the same item into 9 steps. This represents making this operation 85% times faster than originally designed, but its value is really represented when you know players will have to perform it multiple times throughout the game.
