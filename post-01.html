<h3 id="article-topic"> Problem </h3>
<p id="article-text">
Crafting an item multiple times in a row is one of the heaviest interactions on the
game. When taking on the process you will be faced with multiple menu interactions,
animations and text dialogue. The cherry on the cake is when you open the crafting
menu bringing you back to the last option you had previously selected to help you chain
crafting the same item. It feels like the developpers knew players would need to
craft an item more than once but didn't go whole way to give you a multi-craft
option.
</p>
<br>
</br>
<p id="article-text">
To create multiples, the process list reads as follow:
<ul class="a">
    <li>Interact with the crafting bench</li>
    <li>Crafting dialogue</li>
    <li>Select the crafting option</li>
    <li>Select the item you want to craft</li>
    <li>Confirm you want to craft it</li>
    <li>Crafting animation</li>
    <li>Completion dialogue</li>
    <li>Select the "Keep Crafting" option</li>
    <li>Character turnaround animations</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
</br>
<p id="article-text">
After the character turnaround, you are brought back to the item selection menu.
To get some perspective, creating 10 of the same item is a 63 step program, 9
steps for the first item, then 9 loops of 6 steps for the remaining items.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="article-topic"> Solution </h3>
<p id="article-text">
The goal would be to reduce the amount of steps required by breaking that loop
and giving the player a straight line to what they want.
<br>
<br>
That straight line instead would involve adding a step to ask the player how many
of the item they want to craft, simple as that. When seeing this problem for the
first time, I instantly got in my mind Pokemon's Pokemart options to buy the same
item in bulk. It's a simple system that works well and has been part of their
games since the begining of the series.

<br>
<br>
<p id="article-text">
For comparison, Pokemon's process list reads as follow:
<ul class="a">
    <li>Interact with the Pokemart vendor</li>
    <li>Vendor dialogue</li>
    <li>Select the buy option</li>
    <li>Select the item you want to buy</li>
    <li>Select how many you want of the item</li>
    <li>Confirm your purchase</li>
    <li>Completion dialogue</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
</br>
<p id="article-text">
After the completion dialogue, you are brough back to the item selection menu.
In total to get 10 items, it would take the player 7 actions, 9 to exit the menus
and get back to playing.
</p>
<br>
</br>
<h3 id="article-topic"> What it would look like </h3>
<p id="article-text">
Between step 04 and 05, have a menu open and ask the player “how many would you
like to craft?” and have a counter appear. Using the joystick or d-pad up you
add more of the item to create, using the joystick or d-pad down to lessen the
amount. You can use B to come back or A to accept the amount you want to create.
When you press A, there is a check to see if there is enough space in your
inventory to create that many items before the confirmation step 05. If you
don’t have enough space, a message appears: “There isn’t enough space in your
bag to fit all of these, take some things out before!”, then the menu closes so
you can check your inventory to decide what to remove to make space.
