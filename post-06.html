<h3 id="article-topic"> Current observation </h3>
<p id="article-text">
Many recent games have added a crafting system to their game play
experience since the release of Minecraft. To some degree, it has become such a
buzzword that it has lost a lot of it's original flare and purpose. To this day,
not only has it grafted itself on major titles, but is now pretty
much always an integral part of modern mobile games as well. Wether it's
because your marketing team said your game should have crafting in it, or you
just want to recreate an awesome experience you've had, popular things become
stale.

<h3 id="article-topic"> Symptoms of a bad system </h3>
<p id="article-text">
In essence, there is nothing wrong with it. Many games have reaped
the benefits of a well integrated crafting system, wether it being at the
front of their gameplay experience or as a secondary system. Where it becomes
apparent of being a product of second thought or forced design is when you
see exemples of situations like these start developping:
<br>
<br>
- The system feels artificial and only is there to add narrative fluff, clutters
the user interactions in the game by adding useless loot, which most probably
90% of will never be used.
<br>
<br>
- If the crafting system is not part of the core player progression and there
are other systems in play to ensure the player can progress, when the player
does progress, chances are they will always get better items from other systems.
This interaction devalues the time required to farm and use the craft system.
<br>
<br>
- There are so many crafting options that 70% of them don't serve an actual
purpose to the game except filling in an artificial void to make you feel like
the game has depth. The other 30% actually has a use into making you decide
between what you want or what is actually the obvious choice you should make in
terms of efficiency.

<h3 id="article-topic"> The secret ingredient </h3>
Simply put, the magic behind the crafting system experience comes from it's
nature of being a progression wall, that's it. It's very simple and most games
that have a good crafting system use it in a way to push the player into more
advanced content. Common reactions to a well designed crafting system:
<br>
- Experimentation, surprise and excitement for trying combinations or gambling
<br>
- Achievement, progression and accomplishement for obtaining something of value
<br>
-
<br>
<br>
In essence, your crafting system should not dilute your player's experience of
the game progression and reward system or clutter him with something he will
never use. For one part, it will show bad design, but also make you playtest
and design a bunch of content that don't actually add more to the game at all.
<br>
<br>
A common trend to force players into a useless crafting system is adding
side-quests to start getting you to use said crafting system. If the system
actually worked properly you wouldn't need to push players into it, players
would be looking for it. How so? By simply running into a progression wall,
looking into a solution, and realising they need to use the crafting system as
an answer.
<br>
<br>
Don't agree to the last statement? Remember that the most popular crafting game
to this day is still Minecraft and it's being played by some of the youngest
gaming audience on console, pc and mobile. If they can find how to use a
crafting system to progress, everyone should be able to. But how to they make
it so easy for kids to figure out then? By making it the center of the gameplay
experience and pointing to it right from the start, making it useful from the
start, and making it an integral part of your actual progression. It creates
it's own loop that even young players recognize and understand right from the
first actions you can make in the game.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In all the games that have crafting systems, the ones that work the best have
these aspects in common and all these aspects work in concert:
<br>
A. They are useful
<br>
B. They are fun to use
<br>
C. They get a sense of progression that drives them forward in the game
<br>
D. It opens new things to discover for the player
<br>
<br>
As soon as you can't get all these aspects to be present for your crafting
system, it either falls short or makes no sense.
